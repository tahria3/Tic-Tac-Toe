# Tic-Tac-Toe
Description:
•	The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
•	Each cell in the grid can be empty, marked with "X," or marked with "O."
•	Typically, two players participate in Tic-Tac-Toe, taking turns to make a move.
•	One player uses "X," and the other uses "O."
•	Players take turns to place their symbol ("X" or "O") in an empty cell on the grid.
•	The first player to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols wins the game.
•	The game can end in a win, a draw, or continue until players decide to stop.
•	Players alternate turns, with each player making one move per turn.
•	A player cannot place their symbol in a cell that is already occupied.
•	The game is won when a player successfully forms a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
•	Once a player wins, the game typically ends, and the winning player is declared.
•	If the entire grid is filled, and no player has formed a line of three, the game is a draw (also known as a tie or a cat's game).
•	The game is often played on a simple interface, such as a console application, where players input their moves by specifying the cell number.
•	Each number represents a cell on the board. Players choose a number to place their symbol in the corresponding cell.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic and widely recognized game, known for its simplicity and strategic depth.
